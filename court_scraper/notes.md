# general notes

- pandas is good for getting text content of tables from html, but if you want more depth gotta use sd4 (or equivalent)

- could use sqlacodegen to autogenerate python models from a db

- signin form different from long form??? why....

__Don't let anything fail silently, ever.... what a pain__

- GPT is not good enough at doing structured data yet, don't use it, or if used it will need a heavy vetting/editing.

# dotenv --file .env.dev run -- python src/main.py

^ is to run with dotenv or .env.dev
